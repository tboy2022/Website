Q: Is every game reviewed on the website child-friendly?
A: No, not every game reviewed withinâ€™ this website is child-friendly as we do review heavier and darker games that are certainly not appropriate to be exposed by children and young adults.  We review games that all PEGI rated and discuss games each of the age ratings which are 3, 7, 12, 16 or 18.

Q: Do you only review new, fresh and upcoming games?

Therefore we do review older games which can be months, years or decades old if there is enough interest there.
