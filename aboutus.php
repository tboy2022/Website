<details>
  <summary>Q: Is every game reviewed on the website child-friendly?</summary>
  <div class="faq__content">
    <p>A: No, not every game reviewed withinâ€™ this website is child-friendly as we do review heavier and darker games that are certainly not appropriate to be exposed by children and young adults.  We review games that all PEGI rated and discuss games each of the age ratings which are 3, 7, 12, 16 or 18. Although, at the top of each review under the game title, there will be an age rating listed which can leave you reassured if a game is appropriate.  </p>

<details>
  <summary>Q: Do you only review new, fresh and upcoming games? </summary>
  <div class="faq__content">
    <p>A: While we do certainly review new and upcoming video games, we are not limited to that at all with our aim being reviewing, giving opinion and educating on games we believe the general public are interested in. Therefore we do review older games that can be months, years or decades old if there is enough interest there.  </p>
