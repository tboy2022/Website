<h2>Cris Tales</h2>
<div class="game-desc"> 
This game was developed by both Uncorporated Games and Syck and published at Modus Games Japanese RPG game that fans of it will love. The game’s story lead is a child orphan called Crisbell whose life changes forever once she meets a new cute small frog who has a top hat and steals a rose from her and quickly after, she is a foreseen Time Mage which means she has the ability to see both the past and future at the same time with today. Taking advantage of her new powers, she goes on a mission to protect the world from the evil Time Empress with a team of bizarre companions, the frog and other people who have the same ability. 
<br>
<br>
The plot of this game is not always groundbreaking although the storytelling is another question with it always managing the entertain and engage with the player with a good example being times where Crisbell can tweak the future for good but that doesn’t lead to a positive one for everyone. The game has a big emphasis on the moral dilemma with the player being tested on what’s right and wrong with a perfect example being how there is a possibility being saving storefronts from rot being possible at the start but only one is able to gain this.  
<br>
<br>
Overall, this game is a really good RPG and puzzle game that adds in some unexpected but effective gameplay ideas and a good artistic look. This game does just barely enough to be an entertaining game that every RPG player needs.

<h2>Human: Fall Flat </h2>
<div class="game-desc">
This game combines the best aspects of all action, adventure and puzzle games and create a solid game that gives a different vibe of fun. This game created by the developer No Brakes Game is a calm paced game that makes the player manage and control the character who is a canvas white being with zero detail through different obstacles to succeed and move forward. While the game is not the edge of seat fun throughout, it is fun enough to play with ease and controlling him will not be a burden but end up pleasant and adoring.
<br>
<br>
In the game, you control the white being and his limbs are so movable that the slightest pressure can make them wobble and you need those moved well enough to pass numerous puzzles to move on and it seems simpler than it actually is with different objects and buttons being difficult to control with how week his limbs are and you need to be an expert at the character to move forwards and go ahead knowing him and he is controlled. Feels a bit like controlling a drunk being which can be fun but also insanely annoying.  
<br>
<br>
Human: Fall Flat will be a really nice game to play for a while being it contain elements of some simplicity which one needs at times but also challenges you for the better and allows you to use your brain in a fun way which is why I feel it appeals and would entertain to all ages as the simplistic factor with solid gameplay is a good combo.

<h2>Breakout: Recharged </h2>
<div class="game-desc">
This classic game that has been played for decades since its creation in 1976 on a series of different devices such as iPods and Blackberry mobiles as a simple yet effective game to entertain is back and better than ever. The game which as the player controlling a paddle at the bottom of the screen as it moves side to side thanks to player has been modernized for the 21st century while thankfully keeping the original formula and concept. 
<br>
<br>
In Breakout: Recharged, there are several ways to play the game such as playing the original simple game while trying to improve your skill and improve the last and best high score. While, a challenge mode has been introduced with challenges involving breaking a specific amount of blocks or surviving for a certain n amount of time etc.  
<br>
<br>
This game will be attractive to look as with gameplay being buttery smooth and the clear, crisp yet simple neon style of it looking fun and satisfying. With the game being easy to function and play without feeling like a chore.

<h2>Nuts </h2>
<div class="game-desc">
This game is based mostly upon squirrels with the player’s character being a rookie field investigator where different resources such as GPS, a map, caravan and a camera will be used to research into the mysterious fields of Malmoth Forest. However, as a player investigates the local squirrel community a very bizarre riddle is solved.
<br>
<br>
Throughout the game, you will be completing different kinds of puzzles all around such as logic, timing and surveillance). The squirrels will be monitored through implementing CCTV and watching the clips afterwards at night which allows you to monitor the motion of a squirrel and where exactly they are keeping their food. This game becomes more bizarre every day in the game and there is a chance you’ll worry as their behaviour becomes worse as the player. The theory will pop into your head of is the squirrels working against us at all and why is this case important and a thing? 
<br>
<br>
For animal lovers especially squirrels or people who just loved any puzzles to commit to. I would recommend this game but minus those niches, I would not suggest it as it can be incredibly repetitive and being to play with not a lot on.

<h2>AO Tennis </h2>
<div class="game-desc">
The game AO Tennis argues that it is ‘the most advanced tennis game ever produced,’ but it’s claim doesn’t really manage expectations. The game isn’t even good compared to the quality of games such as Top Spin that were brought out at the generation of consoles before. This game is shows that it was half-efforted and not creative. 
<br>
<br>
The visuals on this game is brilliant with clear shots, good audio and a high framerate all being big pluses on this game and make it really aesthetically pleasing.
<br>
<br>
Overall, the concept behind it is great and creative but how undeveloped it is sad really how let down it is however there is hope that a lot more features and bugs can be fixed soon to make it a worthwhile game.
