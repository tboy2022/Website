Review - Dying Light 2 Stay Human  
 
3.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action and RPG
Age Rating: 18 
Year of release: 2022 
 
While the story is simple and at times slow to follow through. It has some unforgettable characters and moments in the story and game. Techland do a very good job at making the city feel like a detailed living environment with it’s own politics and concern and the choices in the storyline are delivered well with the stereotype of a good and bad choice not existing here with sacrifices made such as cooperating with bad people to get the best for the city with the adventure and outcome not being predictable. 

This game sequel to the original game that came out in early 2015 with a very lukewarm reception is by far a bigger, better and meaner game.  While, it has been a hot second is once this game was announced all the way back at E3 2018. Development issues staggered the game’s release date such as that the then creative director of the game left after accusations of misbehavior caught up with him. But finally in 2022 it is here although very different to the originally promised and shown game which isn't necessarily a bad thing…. 

The game is a soft reboot of the series’ story arc with it being set in the exact set as the original although we fast-forward a decade and a half where the world is left in a primitive state. Villedor or more commonly known “The City” is used this time with its being done of the final large settlements in the world with Harran left behind. Players play the character of Aiden Caldwell in this game a “Pilgrim” who travels through the decreasing amount of settlements on a mission to find his long-lost sister. Both siblings were abused and used in experiments into a possible deadly vaccine by a doctor called Waltz and is likely that he is in hiding in Villedor. With the game story getting the player to locate him and maybe the sister which won’t be a walk in the park. 

The plot of the story is easy to follow with it leading to a series of complications that expects the mission to becoming harder to follow. With an obstacle followed early on is  discovering that Waltz and character’s sister are more most likely to be in the downtown ‘Central Loop’ of the city. An area that is guarded which means discovering a way of passing them which gets you caught and issued into solving a complicated murder mystery which sets off a massive war between the Peacekeepers and Survivor factions. Getting to the ‘Central Loop’ is a lot more complex that it sounds which it taking longer than 10 hours of playtime. 

There is a lot to like about this game. The game is incredibly smooth to play with there being no lag to suffer from and the playing environment being vivid and almost life-like which makes the game really engaging to play because you feel like you are the player and not playing a console. Another big selling point is how this isn't a stereotypical game which the character teaming up with villains etc. 

The worst thing about this game is how slow and long the game can feel to play. While, it can seem positive that it lasts longer, the duration of the game can make this game feel very dull at time and you just want something over and done with.  

While the story is simple and at times slow to follow through. It has some unforgettable characters and moments in the story and game. Techland do a very good job at making the city feel like a detailed living environment with its own politics and concern and the choices in the storyline are delivered well with the stereotype of a good and bad choice not existing here with sacrifices made such as cooperating with bad people to get the best for the city with the adventure and outcome not being predictable. 


Review - Shadow Warrior 3  
 
3.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action 
Age Rating: 18+ 
Year of release: 2022 
 
Shadow Warrior 3 lasts around 8 to 10 hours in duration but there ain’t a boring moment within it with acrobatics being a burden but combat within the game such as slicing through enemies and sudden changes of tactics being flawless. Lo’s sparky comments really add to this story and game with this game being a great love letter to the blood filled shooter games of previous years. 
 
Shadow Warrior is the latest game released in the Shadow Warrior series which is developed by Flying Wild Hog and released by Devolver Digital. While, the exploration of this game isn't the best and little rough, this is undoubtably an incredibly fun game to play at the combat side with the quick nature of this game never achieving mediocrity and always challenging and amusing. 

The character of Lo Wang is back in this sequel but previous event not leading to a positive outcome in his life. The arc and villain of this game is an ancient dragon that brings terror to the world and each attempt to kill it has fouled. He is weak against the dragon therefore has to create an alliance with his former nemesis Orochi Zilla in killing and beating the ancient dragon as generic weapons will not slay it. Both of them go on a journey to search magical artifacts that are put around the land in the quest to create a powerful weapon to kill the dragon. The issue they face is hordes of yoke are around the land and it is down to Lo Wang to kill his way through them. 

The game has some light RPG elements with the player finding orbs that are spent in improving the character through his abilities and weapons but works as an old-school 1st person shooter as a base in actuality. Most of the combat within this game is set in small combat areas where Lo is trapped until he has killed his enemies. The game starts with a katana and revolver which is used to destroy weak enemies while as the enemies become badder grenade launchers and twin uzis are used. With badder enemies including huge katana-wielding yokai that can block gunfire or floating helmets whose weak point is on the back of their head.  

There is a lot to like about SW3, to play the game it does feel satisfying with the game feeling consistent visually, it also is brilliant to look and play visually which is a major plus as an aesthetically pleasing game taking gaming experience to another level.  The biggest like about the game and playing it is how excellent the combat feels on it which clearly engages you as a player. 

Although, not everything about the game is great and smooth-sailing, the story’s writing isn't Shakespearian with it feeling quite cheesy at times, the 3rd act of the game also can feel quite boring and the whole thing tends to feel forced as a cash-grab. This game also isn't the best game to navigate neither unless you are a heavy gamer which can isolate the average Joe. 

Shadow Warrior 3 lasts around 8 to 10 hours in duration but there isn't a boring moment within it with acrobatics being a burden but combat within the game such as slicing through enemies and sudden changes of tactics being flawless. Lo’s sparky comments really add to this story and game with this game being a great love letter to the blood filled shooter games of previous years. 


Review - The King of Fighters XV 
 
4.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action 
Age Rating: 13 
Year of release: 2022 
 
The 15th! Game within the King of Fighters franchise is finally here after 2 years of Covid delays with it certainly being worth the wait. The story of this game carries on from its predecessor with a mystery being called Verse destroying the previous battle area and being defeating by winning challenges. This time it seems that a new storm is on the way to stop any tournament action from occurring. The plot of this story does not really take the front seat for this game but multiplayer action battling with other gamers and possible moves to use against overshadow that. The game’s picture quality is top notch with the game being stunning to look at with all fighters being cel-shaded 3D models which are impressive to look at and each player has 8 different colour outfits for their costumes which prevent the players looking boring and being versatile. The background of these stages not being too bad at all to look at as well with it being obvious that gaming developers not rushing this aspect of the game. Each game feels personalized.  

This new sequel contains 39 different characters you can choose to fight in with familiar faces to fans of the franchise being in the mix. Each character will also be given to a team out of 13 potential ones. Each team contains 3 members each and once playing it is very obvious which game you are playing for. The movement of characters and animation work brilliantly as well with the battles remaining exciting to play and quick. If a computer can beat you in a battle, the option of either weakening them, strengthening yourself or both is available once you lose. This might give the needed push to move forward and 4 different types of attacks are offered here which are Light Punch, Light Kick, Hard Punch, and Hard Kick with an option of ‘Rush Mode-Auto Combo’ being offered once one form of attack is used 3 times in a row.  

The game is available to be used either locally or online with single player or multiplayer being available in both with a new type of multiplayer being introduced here called “Draft vs” which does not allow both players to use exact the same character for a battle which makes a game a lot more interesting when both cannot use exactly the same character in battle. 

Visually this game is brilliant to play and to look at. Both visual effects and stages look brilliant and really does add to the story. The game also runs smooth as butter with zero lag helping during fighting scenes which with a high frame rate helps create an incredible gaming experience with player’s moves occurring instantly. 

The biggest letdown of this game is how each character do not have an intro nor theme fighting which creates a loss for appeal. There are some annoying bugs that are notable during the games as well which can be a big nuisance and at times affect the players’ gaming experience. 

This game is a lot of fun if you enjoy fighting games or the King of Fighters gaming series with it being much fun to use as well if you are inexperienced in fighting games. This is a barrel of fun in both sides of experience with chaotic moves and attacks assuming any player. This is a game that will entertain the fussiest player with ease.  


Review - Breakout: Recharged 
 
3 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action and Puzzle
Age Rating: 3+ 
Year of release: 2022 

This classic game that has been played for decades since its creation in 1976 on a series of different devices such as iPods and Blackberry mobiles as a simple yet effective game to entertain is back and better than ever. The game which as the player controlling a paddle at the bottom of the screen as it moves side to side thanks to player has been modernized for the 21st century while thankfully keeping the original formula and concept. 
 
In Breakout: Recharged, there are several ways to play the game such as playing the original simple game while trying to improve your skill and improve the last and best high score. While, a challenge mode has been introduced with challenges involving breaking a specific amount of blocks or surviving for a certain n amount of time etc.  

This game introduces a wide arrange of power-ups such as having several balls on the go or blocks that explode once contacted. The main survival mode will introduced them at random times unless disabled. Might seem simple but this game isn't as easy as it seems with losing being a regular occurrence at first unless trained on the game.  

This game can be attractive to look as with gameplay being buttery smooth and the clear, crisp yet simple neon style of it looking fun and satisfying. With the game being easy to function and play without feeling like a chore. 

Despite the backdrop, colour scheme and music being a great selection to appeal to the public, after a while the game and these attributes can become jarring as you are used to seeing and hearing them again and again 

If you enjoy playing the original, you will certainly like this as it keeps the exact same formula just modernized and improved. Contains an attractive colour scheme of mostly purple and blue hues with look great on an OLED screen such as the Nintendo Switch OLED model and has a good soundtrack to work with it as well. This is a great love letter to the original while improving the game majorly with the challenge mode implemented. 


Review - Gamedec 
 
4 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action, Adventure, RPG and Sci-Fi 
Age Rating: 18 
Year of release: 2021 
 
Anshar Studios’ new and exciting cyberpunk inspired game has a lot to life up to compared to previous injustice player-controlled games such as Disco Elysium and Fallout. The year of delay of this game has certainly been worth it as this game is a fascinating Sci-Fi experience and universe where the player unusually has to adopt the role of a cyberspace detective who has to investigate and figure out crimes that have occurred in virtual space. A slight downfall of the game is how the extent of how open and configurable it is allowing for too many choices for players to commit which overshadows and lets down the game’s unity, especially at the start of the game which makes keeping immersion much harder than it actually needs to be. 
 
This game is set in Warsaw City which is a megalopolis that is extending to the airspace and created in the wreck there is in Old Warsaw. The lead character and who the player controls have a job role as a Gamedec which is a detective that is qualified in figuring out where people is and discovering any wrongdoings in virtual space. This game is set in the later era of the 22nd century where humans spend most of their time in several life-like online VR spaces where resources such as health pills and sofas are all virtual in longer sessions in most houses were only for those in poverty it not occurring. The fact that someone can be discreet online for those avatars using it has bought the worst side of people in an era that is already declining fast.  
 
The runtime of this game is 15 hours and throughout it, codex entries are found to do a lot of construction and improve their land. There is a lot of private information available for players to find and expose it all through older and alien platforms for time - tv and radio. This game shows a bleak, sad yet maybe realistic future although interesting to research and discover. 
 
The game has a lot of great elements to it with it being a captivating game about the future where the world is incredibly engaging and gives the player power with them being responsible for choices that make differences and are vital. Image-wise this game definitely works as well with the art of the creators being stunning to both look at and play. Another brilliant factor to this game is just how well it works if you want to replay the game with it not being a bore or chore. The game also excels at bringing many different game genres with different elements of each Adventure, Action, RPG and Sci-Fi and creating a very solid game with it. 
 
Although, this game has some flaws that ruin its potential of being perfect such as how there are noticeable mistakes in the dialogue throughout the game and how some easter eggs and hints within this game are totally pointless and vague. The audio of this game isn't the best either with music in the background being distracting and having nothing to do with the story. There are definitely bugs within this game as well which can make it very hard to play without issues and time delays. 
 
This game is mostly solid and is totally a game to play even if not as flawless as similar games. It is an exciting game that challenges players and is playable over and over without the way overused need of having sword, knuckles or guns as potential combats and the need in other games to survive. This is a refreshing change where head is used not a weapon as defense. 
 

Review - Hades 
 
4.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: RPG and Action 
Age Rating: 12 
Year of release: 2018 
 
The lead character of this game, Zagreus finds himself in a similar unfortunate position  to a lot people in the world stuck in the world and by an abusive senior figure and try to figure a way out. Zagreus has an advantage to help himself in such an awful situation as he is an immortal god although sadly his abuser is his dad Hades who is even higher up than him as ‘the lord of the Underworld’. Zagreus’ sad misery makes an adventurous game for players to play that even non-‘pro’ games can also admire. 
 
The plot of the game is how the lead character seeks a way to be free after spending his whole life in the Underworld and is driven by fresh news for him learning about his birth mum Persephone who vanished years before. Zagreus gains the support of his adoptive mum Myx, the gods of Olympus who have only become aware of him and other known names in Greek mythology. He escapes through his bedroom window although each time he fails, he is bought back to the hub and needs to strive again to leave. 
 
Most of the game is spent fighting people within Underworld who are trying to stop him and defeat them to ensure that can move on easily. Anticipation is strong throughout the game with the player never actually being aware what will occur next. Players walk through combat rooms in this game to move on forwards and succeed with there always being 1-3 doorways to walk through with some boot earnt with each door. 
 
The game has much a player could and will love such as how the game contains quick action throughout, responsive controls that make fighting others quick and effective. It is also unexpected which adds to the glory of the game with something new always around the corner that could be effective. This game looks great as well with a high refresh rate and nice atmospheric colour pallet that looks excellent. This is a brilliant and fresh Action and RPG (Which aren't the lightest games to play) game that anyone and their nan can play with pleasure. 
 
The only annoyance with this game is how the script can be apparently awful, poor and cringeworthy but the actual game and it’s clear appeal way overweigh this with it still being a good game. 
 
This is a solid game with almost a perfect score that will attract any kind of player, no one will regret playing it. While their reputation is strong this is by far Supergiant’s best game unarguably which is not easy to accomplish at all. 
 

Review - Psychonauts 2 
 
4.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action and Adventure 
Age Rating: 7  
Year of release: 2021 
 
This long-awaited sequel to this cartoon and amusing game filled with laughter, solid story-lining and charming characters introduced in 2005 is back and better than ever with it not being just a sequel but a classic in its own right. 
 
This game is set just mere days after the first game and only moments after the spin-off sequels it gathered. Here you play psychic child genius Razputin Aquato and Razputin just saved Truman Zanotto, the leader of the Psychonauts from rogue dental/brain surgeon Dr. Loboto. Your mission within’ this game is to figure out who exactly hired Loboto to kidnap the Psychonaut agents in the first film by going inside his head to discover there is a bigger evil here called Maligula who is a known nemesis of the Psychonauts. Maligula was presumed dead after a war that left one of the best Psychonauts mentally scarred and damaged which leads them to believe there is someone working for the other side within the team and to investigate. You have to go inside the heads of the creators of the Psychonauts dubbed Psychic 6. 
 
This is a superb game that clearly has been well thought out and is incredibly detailed, down to small elements such as the past to the characters and their nemesis and everything in-between is brilliant. This is a really expressive and creative game which handles some real life issues incredibly well with grace and care such as PTSD, worry and addiction while showing they are human traits and at times touching it in a very light way that doesn’t mock these traits. 
 
The game is phenomenal with many good targets being hit here. The characters and backgrounds are nice, colourful and vibrant which makes it a pleasure to play and brilliant to look at. Writing and direction of this game is also amazingly good with it cooperating as a game in a very good and non-jarring manor. The main character Raz is also a fierce and accomplished protagonist to play as and most importantly it covers real life issues such as mental health in a humble and kind way without any stigma being thrown. Combat on this game is also 100% top tier with fighting as Raz being energetic and fun with platforming being another excellent area of gameplay. 
 
The only issue there is with this game is how some fights within the game feel like it occurs to gain experience and power not to finish something on a rewarding note. 
 
Overall this game is absolutely brilliant and I would recommend for absolutely anyone to play it as it can be a lot of fun for all the family. You shall regret not playing it sooner and I’d argue this is even better than the original which was really hard to achieve! 
 

Review - It Takes Two 
 
5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action and Adventure 
Age Rating: 12 
Year of release: 2021 
 
This game has had been dubbed one of the best both action and adventure genre game adventures of all time and boy they weren’t wrong. This artistic game takes ideas and takes them to a different proportion with a player of this game needing to be expected to run from moles, spiders in the gardens, battling microphones that are similar to snakes, ice skating within a snow globe and to fly but it is so much fun and a lot more than expected which left us surprised. 
 
The creators of this game Hazelight’s prior game A way out wasn’t too bad at all but this turns it up to 11 with everything about the game being almost flawless which drags you into loving the game. Whatever your mission to move forward to the next level or communicating with giant devices around this game will never be a bore and you will 100% always be entertained here. Racing slugs in multiplayer, playing the game Bop-It or climbing up is only just some of the fun potentials you have within the game wherever you are the bathroom, closet, garage etc. 
 
The gameplay of the actual game is instantly reactive and strong with no slacking occurring here with any element being fun to control such as flying, climbing or running with the game only being multiplayer makes it even a lot more fun and no idea or scenario will be repeated twice leading to hours of fresh fun. The broadness of possibilities is insane! 
 
This game also pays homage to other iconic games throughout such as Mario Karts or GoW. There are also 25 different minigames playable here which are all barrel laughs with a good example being good old fashioned. 
 
Although there is also depth to this game with it being based around a messy relationship between 2 parents who are extremely close to ending it and how this impacts their little girl Rose who sees all and uses the 2 toys which the player is for a shoulder to cry for with your mission is getting everything on track, therefore, it also is an emotional game. Not all entertainment and games. 
 
This is one of the best games we have reviewed with so much being done absolutely right here such as the writing where you are left in stitches with laughter at times then insane pain feeling over the family which each line from them feeling realistic and passionate. The more the player does, the more the parents remember why they wanted each other and belong together. The gameplay again is immersive and the design and colour scheme of this game is insane. The gameplay feels brilliant and the story is masterful pulling every heartstring thanks to the writer Dr. Hakim is an absolute legend and genius for coming up with it.  
 
Although, if I had to criticize 1 element - it would be how it isn’t as consistently fun as each other at different aspects and levels but always enjoyable. 
 
This game is 100% G.O.A.T. and it is needed to be played by absolutely everyone and their dog as it is so good and charming. This appeals to absolutely everyone and games barely getting better than it! 
 

Review - Human: Fall Flat 
 
4 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action, Adventure and Puzzle 
Age Rating: 3  
Year of release: 2016 
 
This game combines the best aspects of all action, adventure and puzzle games and create a solid game that gives a different vibe of fun. This game created by the developer No Brakes Game is a calm paced game that makes the player manage and control the character who is a canvas white being with zero detail through different obstacles to succeed and move forward. While the game is not the edge of seat fun throughout, it is fun enough to play with ease and controlling him will not be a burden but end up pleasant and adoring. 
 
In the game, you control the white being and his limbs are so movable that the slightest pressure can make them wobble and you need those moved well enough to pass numerous puzzles to move on and it seems simpler than it actually is with different objects and buttons being difficult to control with how week his limbs are and you need to be an expert at the character to move forwards and go ahead knowing him and he is controlled. Feels a bit like controlling a drunk being which can be fun but also insanely annoying.  
 
The game has been considered easier than it actually s with handling and maintaining onto objects feeling impossible at times. Puzzles within this game become harder and harder which surprises a user that thought it was  gonna be like stealing candy from a baby and it does take around 5 hours to finish this game with each puzzle requiring you to look around before making the wrong one the spur decision although a benefit is how there are different solutions to an issue with innovation being encouraged here. and the fun does not stop there as a player can play with another member in multiplayer which is double the fun and levitates the game, especially humour which is already here. 
 
There is much to like here such as how it is bundles of fun both as a multiplayer or as a single person, how the puzzles are creative, challenge and broad is another brilliant point within this game but despite the player thinking and being challenged. It never becomes unbearable nor frustrating and the physics of the character is a lot of entertainment to play around with. There is also a high refresh rate here which will show your actions immediately which is superb. 
 
Although, it isn't the perfect game with some teething issues throughout. An issue faced is how it can become jading after a while of playing alone as it is the same old and how grabbing onto something for a period of time is a bit corrupt. Visually there is not a lot to look at nor impressive graphics either as it is just 1 player and a plain white background through the game therefore does not look satisfying and feels a bit bleak to look at. 
 
Human: Fall Flat is a really nice game to play for a while being it contain elements of some simplicity which one needs at times but also challenges you for the better and allows you to use your brain in a fun way which is why I feel it appeals and would entertain to all ages as the simplistic factor with solid gameplay is a good combo. 
 

SCI-FI:

Review - Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order 
 
4 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sci-Fi 
Age Rating: 16+ 
Year of release: 2019 
 
This game in Star Wars gaming franchise which feels separate from the films that created them is an interesting play which for once is a game in the franchise to nails how Stars Wars should feel not just look.  

The key to this game’s story is friendship with it being core in both gameplay and storyline. The friendship arc of this game is between Cal Kestis who is a Jedi padawan that is hiding after the Jedi Purge that occurred Revenge of the Sith and BD-1 who is droid is given a secret task by the Jedi Master that owned it. After Cal and BD-1 meet, they become inseparable and cooperate well to solve puzzles in forgotten ruins, explore alien environments and get revenge on the Empire. 

Both work in the game to complete a scavenger hunt that was made by BD's last companion, Master Cordova. Before he disappeared, Cordova hid a list of Force-sensitive children throughout the galaxy that could be used to bring back the ruined Jedi Order and challenge the Empire. Clues were left on how to get back the list hidden in BD, meaning Cal and the droid need to explore multiple worlds after Cordova did to free up BD's encrypted memories. 

This game can be very tough and both BD’s support and possible upgrades are needed in this game to go through. Enemies within’ this game are very powerful and hard to out-power. Both the player and villain have a stamina meter to support and control with it telling you how much blows you can take/give before making yourself or them too weak while fighting them to pass through. This games also loves to give the player several enemies to fight at once.  

There is a lot to love with this game such as how the difficulty can give you the a realistic gaming experience of feeling like a Jedi while being aware of the difficulty. Characters within’ this game is another powerful aspect of this game with it helping a player to experience elements of the franchise. Combat is also spot on in this game with it not being a walk in the park for players and making the player to be self-aware and to think. Visually this game is brilliant with a high frame rate, picturesque to play in and giving a responsive nature.  

Although, this game is not perfect with a few bad points with the biggest one being how the whole story starts too slow and makes it bland with it taking time to improve. Battles within this game can be annoying was well when checkpoints to go on through being very far at times. The only down point in actual playing quality of this game is the navigation and how playing it can be unnecessarily complex on the controller. 

If you have ever thought how exactly it would be to be a Jedi and want to experience it, this is truly the perfect game for it with it being very engaging and realism being key here. 


Review - Journey To The Savage Planet 
 
3.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sci-Fi and Adventure
Age Rating: 13+ 
Year of release: 2020 
 
The story behind Journey To The Savage Planet is a "savage planet" that brings up thoughts of hostility and survival, exploring the possible death through the dangers of life on the frontiers of space. While there are murderous objects out to get you in Journey to the Savage Planet, it isn't the point of the game and only a minor gimmick rather than the main meaning. Developer of the game, Typhoon Studios centers the game on the importance of exploration while tying it with real humour and an amusing tone to give us a light and singularly focused chunk of sci-fi adventuring. 

The setting of the whole game is on a single planet located deep in unmonitored space. You're pushed into the space boots of an employee of Kindred Aerospace--a rinky-dink outfit that's proud and humble of its status of being rated the fourth-best interstellar exploration company, which makes you think how bad competition could actually be. Once your feet encounter the planet itself, you'll begin to see the flora, fauna, and beings across the various biomes of planet AR-Y 26 to see whether it's fit for human habitation or not with the whole climate change thing ruining Earth. 

This game is also playable as multiplayer with a friend which enhances the game and makes combat much more fun but playing it multiplayer doesn’t affect the game itself nor storyline at all. The option of exploring together or going and exploring different places are both options. Humour is key in this game, while playing with a friend can have its moments. The game itself is without issue funny with the high amount of full-motion videos on the player’s ship. These clips show humour and parody a lot of different topics such as the video game industry and corrupt policies at big companies.  

There is a lot to like in this light and fun game. The stupid but fun humour is actually laughable and engages the player. Exploring the planet isn't a chore neither while being full of fun and valuable things to discover. The colour scheme of this game and how neon it is appeals to the gamer while playing as well especially with an automatic response on screen with a high fresh rate. 

A downside to the game can be how satire it is for some hardcore gamers as well with it being off-putting for some. Some apparent bugs also disappoint players as well because it ruins the experience at times and makes it hard to play it with different elements going wrong agitating people. 

This game is clearly a very fun and light game that is needed at times when life is heavy as it is a brilliant escape and isn't a chore to play. Playing Journey To The Savage Planet can be a very relaxing experience thanks to its humour, lightness and engaging gameplay. 


Review - Aliens: Fireteam Elite 

2.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sci-Fi 
Age Rating: 16+ 
Year of release: 2021 

This latest Sci-Fi game based on the Alien franchise that centers around a lot of shooting is a great laugh and time when played with a simple and wacky mindset. This game which is inspired by other gaming franchises such as Gears of War which makes it feel a bit unoriginal is saved by small yet effective original elements and the setting of the Alien movies which make it very playful and engaging which is impressive to consider how dialogue in this game can be questionable, the uninspired story and non-player characters who are able to communicate with their mouths closed without any creative excuses to justify why that occurs.  

The story of this game takes place years after the Alien films. The character played here is appropriate Colonial Marines on a mission to various panic signals. This game could definitely be considered third-person shooter with the player attempting to get the needed targets and striving to clear out places within the game that are full of Xenomorphs. This is a brilliant game to play with loved ones online as you are able to cooperate in a team. 5 different classes to pick from, that all contain personalized qualities such as a technician role. 

The entertainment factor of this game can depend on whether you do play with other humans or the non-player bots that are bleak and none verbal which can making it a relatively boring situation. With other players, it can be a barrel of laughs and amusing time but without, it can seem like a bit of a chore to play and complete. 

The positives for this game include how realistic it feels and how as a player, you do feel like you are playing on an Alien film and the potential fun factor of playing it online. It is also fun that it does not take itself too seriously and is a decent shooter sci-fi game. Visually, the setting again looks authentic and detailed, the game thankfully is easy to navigate on a controller as well which is a big plus.  

But there are a lot of negatives to this game as well such as how developers did not even bother to make non-player characters to communicate naturally, how at times this game does feel like a rip off to other games that have been released, communication between the characters of the game is jarring and cringeworthy at times and how this has not been a game that has been developed to maximum fun with playing solo in mind. 

Overall, this game is not a high point in the Alien video game franchise but decent enough to play if you are a fan of both the movie and shooter game otherwise I would avoid and play a better similar game such as Gears of War. 


Review - Gamedec

Genre: Sci-Fi, RPG, Adventure and Action 
Age Rating: 18 
Year of release: 2021 
 
Anshar Studios’ new and exciting cyberpunk inspired game has a lot to life up to compared to previous injustice player-controlled games such as Disco Elysium and Fallout. The year of delay of this game has certainly been worth it as this game is a fascinating Sci-Fi experience and universe where the player unusually has to adopt the role of a cyberspace detective who has to investigate and figure out crimes that have occurred in virtual space. A slight downfall of the game is how the extent of how open and configurable it is allowing for too many choices for players to commit which overshadows and lets down the game’s unity, especially at the start of the game which makes keeping immersion much harder than it actually needs to be. 
 
This game is set in Warsaw City which is a megalopolis that is extending to the airspace and created in the wreck there is in Old Warsaw. The lead character and who the player controls have a job role as a Gamedec which is a detective that is qualified in figuring out where people is and discovering any wrongdoings in virtual space. This game is set in the later era of the 22nd century where humans spend most of their time in several life-like online VR spaces where resources such as health pills and sofas are all virtual in longer sessions in most houses were only for those in poverty it not occurring. The fact that someone can be discreet online for those avatars using it has bought the worst side of people in an era that is already declining fast.  
 
The runtime of this game is 15 hours and throughout it, codex entries are found to do a lot of construction and improve their land. There is a lot of private information available for players to find and expose it all through older and alien platforms for time - tv and radio. This game shows a bleak, sad yet maybe realistic future although interesting to research and discover. 
 
The game has a lot of great elements to it with it being a captivating game about the future where the world is incredibly engaging and gives the player power with them being responsible for choices that make differences and are vital. Image-wise this game definitely works as well with the art of the creators being stunning to both look at and play. Another brilliant factor to this game is just how well it works if you want to replay the game with it not being a bore or chore. The game also excels at bringing many different game genres with different elements of each Adventure, Action, RPG and Sci-Fi and creating a very solid game with it. 
 
Although, this game has some flaws that ruin its potential of being perfect such as how there are noticeable mistakes in the dialogue throughout the game and how some easter eggs and hints within this game are totally pointless and vague. The audio of this game isn't the best either with music in the background being distracting and having nothing to do with the story. There are definitely bugs within this game as well which can make it very hard to play without issues and time delays. 
 
This game is mostly solid and is totally a game to play even if not as flawless as similar games. It is an exciting game that challenges players and is playable over and over without the way overused need of having sword, knuckles or guns as potential combats and the need in other games to survive. This is a refreshing change where head is used not a weapon as defense.

In this game created by developer Funktronic Labs is both a dungeon crawler combined with a puzzle game which is a combination of live moments and decision-based gameplay. This game does not outstay its welcome either with the fact that it does not take long to finish although might take a bit longer to discover every secret. The short running time that flies by can also affect the game as it cannot show  its full potential. 
 
The player here operates an orange vessel called Dr Science that is abandoned and stuck after a botched scientific experiment. Other people in the team have been scattered at all of time and space where the player needs to discover what caused this to occur and get back to the scientists. After rescuing other members, they only say 1-2 lines of dialogue then fade into the background. High scores here are monitored by how quickly someone can achieve a level but also how many turns, hidden secrets and people rescued come into it. While Dr Science can speak it is bare to non-funny pun-filled ‘comedy’ which cringes a player up and dialogue of guides. 
 
The game’s navigation is split into elements with 3 planets that do change backgrounds and add new features to the game with them all separated again to 6 unique zones that can be used by an overworld map.  
 
This game is a mostly very strong game with the concept and execution being both clever and entertaining. It is also a brilliant game to play on the go because it isn't demanding to play at all. Visual aspects of the game are positive with being there accurate to the mood of the story at the time with each planet looking unique but in an appropriate way, the same with the aliens who look like they are a part of that planet but again slightly different where you actually notice it. 
 
A bad point of this game to some extent is how annoying how short it is as it does ruin the games’ potential with much more that could be explored here. The game can also be quite buggy which is a nuisance, the low framerate also doesn’t not help as it causes a lag which ruins the experience and make completing them feel like a chore.

Review - Knockout City 

4.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sports 
Age Rating: 10+ 
Year of release: 2021 

Knockout City is a new intense cooperating game based on the US game dodgeball that includes easy moves and skills to learn and develop with professional and complicated maneuvers, this game can bring this to the table whilst looking like a childhood cartoon series. The game is clear and rewarding to play while bringing the benefits of a PE lesson without downfalls. 
 
The visuals and sound of this game are brilliant with the playlist of songs being fun and encouraging and the characters looking good once you pass the fact it can look like a Bratz toy. The setting and scenery are colourful and vibrant with there being cool abjection and mods being available on this game. There is a unique and dope sound the individual balls make when they make contact with a person. the rule of this game is how a gang of 3 or 4 have to defeat and disable the other team by throwing the dodgeballs that cover the whole map at them. One must be struck twice to be knocked out and the gang to make this occur 10 times win. 
 
The tactic is the name of the game here with somewhat mind games being the ultimate power to break your potential victim’s defence. The ball can be struck faster or through a slower one to surprise the victim and their timing. throws that curve around are possible as well. Real person techniques appear here as well. 
 
This game is brilliant with a lot going for it such as how simple yet fun this game is, how colourful and animated the characters and setting are, down to smaller things such as real-life effects like the sound of a ball being thrown. It also thinks out of the box with a ball-less mode being available where you throw other members of a gang to the beat the other. This vibrant game also has a brilliant high-fresh rate which makes it much more realistic and effective. With no bugs being found either this is a silky smooth game to play. 
 
There is not much at all to complain about as the game is finessed. The only critic is how simple the concept can be which will most likely make it boring for one after a while. 
 
This is undoubtedly one of the best player vs player games in a while. It is a hot and modern look at the traditional US school game which means it is playable for almost anyone as it is so simple to play and navigate while being competitive! 


Review - Skatebird

2 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sports 
Age Rating: 12 
Year of release: 2021 

This game which is Pro Skater and Micro Machines put together is like a mediocre meme bought to life with the concept being petit birds riding a fingerboard on minuscule ramps around different settings such as a workplace and a bedroom. This game tries to be a third-dimensional light skateboarding game with the result being an adorable and head-turning yet basic, quick and annoying game to play. 

This is a very random game to come up with and can feel uninspired. Again, Pro Skater is the main inspiration here and the concept they came up with which was to allow whoever was playing to wander around the maps looking for certain unimportant and light tasks. These tasks are thrown all around the map but they are not heavy or essential as a lack of countdown while completing them will show. Unironically, the mood is delivered well with the playlist being full of unforgettable primary bird-related songs. The playlist could be considered the best part here with it being full of calm yet effective songs that even the player aka the birds grooves to. 

This game does not give the player the task and while going around you will encounter them while not closed away from being seen, it can be agitating to control and complete quickly. Most tasks here are quite simple with the actual time to complete it and gather items also being brilliant for laziness and a lot of resources are around the same place at the game while can make the game bland and you are not challenged at all.  

The positive thing about this game is how light it is to play if you do not want to commit too much time or a general player of games. The playlist again also is brilliant, the game is vibrant and fun to look at with all its light colours without gloom. 

Although there are many bad points to this game such as how basic the game is without a need of being challenged with simple tasks and enough time. It doesn’t help how there are only 5 levels to play on therefore there isn't a lot of gameplay with this game without already completing it with a certain level being beige with a nano rooftop. The entertainment of this game isn't helped with the lack of multiplayer to play with others and simple maps to explore. To look at it can be quite annoying as well with how amateur the camera and controls of the game are with it struggling to showcase progress on-screen without hassle where it shakes and the player gets stuck at a bizarre area of the screen with struggle. 

Minus the fact that this game is adorable and with a great music act with it. Skating on this game is outdated, the concept and possibilities are lazy and to view it is a headache. While it can appear amusing, it isn't worth playing unless you really love birds. 


Review - AO Tennis

Genre: Sports 
Age Rating: 3 
Year of release: 2018 

The game AO Tennis argues that it is ‘the most advanced tennis game ever produced,’ but it’s claim doesn’t really manage expectations. The game isn’t even good compared to the quality of games such as Top Spin that were brought out at the generation of consoles before. This game is shows that it was half-efforted and not creative. 
 
Although the game has some creative fresh ideas, the ideas are half-baked due to the fact there aren’t any tutorials in the game with a good example being how the right thumbstick to do shots at and serve. Buttons is another downfall of the game with aiming for good shots, making you hold the shot button to power it up by a gauge that moves next to the player with aiming with a reticle in your opponent's corner.  It seems logical but doesn’t work well in person. A lot of the time, you will move to a position to return to the ball, prepare the shots and release it while the opponent a the game has some creative fresh ideas, the ideas are half-baked due to the fact there aren’t any tutorials in the game with a good example being how the right thumbstick to do shots at and serve.

Often, you will move to a position to return to the ball, prepare the shots, and release it while the opponent awaits as the ball bounces by them.  
 
The visuals on this game is brilliant with clear shots, good audio and a high framerate all being big pluses on this game and make it really aesthetically pleasing.  
 
This game is entertaining enough and if necessary it will be a nice game for someone to play but after a while, it will get a bit boring and people will have enough of the game as it can be a bit frustrating to use with how bad controls are on its controllers. You also cannot practice how good you are at tennis on the game either. The game is very buggy as well with the effort and issues while throwing the ball being a good example. 
 
Overall, the concept behind it is great and creative but how undeveloped it is sad really how let down it is however there is hope that a lot more features and bugs can be fixed soon to make it a worthwhile game. 


Review - Ganbare! Super Strikers 
 
2 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sports, Adventure and RPG 
Age Rating: 3 
Year of release: 2020 
 
To start the review, this game was not a too easy game to implement and play with a lot of technical issues happening straight into Story Mode with a lot of players commonly having to restart the game. While the game does sound interesting being game heavily focused on the genres of RPG, Adventure and Sports and has a nice niche and fresh sound and feel to it. It soon wears thin and the gamer becomes bored quickly. 
 
This game introduces a story mode where the player can customize their own player, team and football team badge. After working through that and choosing whether to follow through with the tutorial or skip ahead, the team can play the 1st of 7 National Cup matches they are going to play and they are followed through with the World Cup matches. If the team wins the game they are able to move on within the tournament with winning allowing one to get up to 3 stars with one always being earnt for winning and the other 2 for going above and beyond in skill and for achievements such as stopping the other teaming from scoring, using special skills in the game etc. These stars are then used to move along to gather better equipment to improve, boost statistics and abilities.  
 
There are 2 fields the player needs to be aware of and monitor- both AP and SP. The SP gauge is drained each time a fellow member of the team moves around or does something with that team member becoming exhausted and losing good statistics once empty while the AP gauge is lowered each time a team member uses special abilities such as tackling a member of the other team making you aware it isn’t a good idea to exhaust these moves. This game works very similarly to how a game of football would actually work. 
 
This game can a fun one to play for a short while with it feeling like a nice quick game to enjoy where you do not have to think too hard. The high refresh rate is another good factor that is implemented within this game which makes the game and ball kicking run smoothly where the player does not have to miss a beat. The coloration of the game is fun and colour as well which keeps the player positive and engaged compared to how they’d be if it was gloomy. 
 
Although, there are enough negatives to this game with a big one being how undercooked it feels despite sounds like a cool and interesting combination, all RPG, Adventure and Sports. This game does not deliver a lot to be improved on to become a solid game. With the standard view of a slanted top-down view not being the best to look at and play in real-time with, members of the team and public blocking the view can make it hard to look at. Stupid stunts within the game ruin its potential as well with unneeded ’features’ such as climate and body height affecting the players’ potential which irks the player and how they feel about the game. 
 
This game clearly does not understand the assignment and is incredibly defective which does not make it a good experience or game to play at all. I would avoid this game at all costs as there is not a USP for anyone and obviously isn’t even that good. 


Review - Windjammers 2 
 
3.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sports 
Age Rating: 3 
Year of release: 2022 
 
 
This game based on the game frisbee is undeniably compelling with it combining both sports and anime with a battle element included to it as an extra selling point. This sequel to the almost three-decade-old game is fresh and vibrant to make loyal and new players alike excited to throw the virtual frisbee and show off their chic tricks that were developed.  
 
The game is simple as again it is only frisbee but multiple methods to make this simplistic game exciting. The player gets an option of a wide area of international characters to play with and gains features like the ability to choose a lot of new defensive and offensive options then combine them to ruin your opponent. This game requires multiple skills to be used such as the mind and body with mind games, fast thinking and genius movement tactics being used to win the battle which contributes to this game bringing a shockingly big appeal for any kind of player.  
 
The game feels hot with the new playable characters adding a new lease of life to it and the fact that multiplayer has been added which is the biggest selling point of the game allowing a player to challenge anyone online such as a loved one which makes it even more competitive although there is also a CPU option to play against with it being shockingly ungenerous towards the player which makes the player itself bring more of themselves towards the table. However, the CPU player can leave one annoyed with how smooth that player is just magically appearing at strange places etc.  
 
The good of this game is brilliant with major selling points including how multi-player is incredible fun that challenges you and that is quick and not slow but also captivating to play. The new defensive and offensive options bring much intensity to the game compared to the original which is needed and appreciated in today’s age. The whole game and online play also work instantly with zero lag with a high fresh rate helping a helping and a vibrant mood board. 
 
Although, the game is not perfect with some issues occurring such as how not a lot has actually changed in this game besides VS play and a basic arcade option to think that it is almost 30. This is also a very difficult and menacing game for inexperienced players to play with a monstrous CPU making any success possibility hard and the lack of development tools for newbies possible. The soundtrack is not great either with the audio in the background not being good taste and a weird selection for the game. 
 
I would recommend this game as it can be a great fun that is colourful, testing in a positive way and so competitive especially if you are a lover of frisbee or the iconic original game. I could also recommend it to a beginner although they would need to be prepared to be a challenge and up their game…., especially against the CPU. 


Review - Skater XL 
 
2.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sports 
Age Rating: 3 
Year of release: 2018 
 
This skating game that is purely about skateboarding with no unnecessary gimmicks gets the technically of the sport to the t in ways such as mastering the spot, location and development and progress from past mistakes. This game falls flat compared to legendary skating games when it fails to encourage a player to move forward and practice different skills and tricks on mediocre uninspired levels. 
 
While the trick system of this game is very easy to understand and exciting to be lectured on. The gaming controls don’t cooperate with the game with 1 analogue stick unrealistic and unplayable if you want to play a videogame about skating properly.  
 
The limited choice of backgrounds and levels within this game cannot be a positive factor with it being a bit boring with only 5 levels made by the developers themselves and another 3 that are community-based. Settings include a skatepark, a rural neighborhood and a school. While these are spots a skateboarder would use they do not feel creative to use at all. The tutorial of this game is also incredibly bare and unfulfilled which doesn’t mention important details and tricks possible with depth. You learn generic tricks in this game and are left to it. 
 
Positives to this game include how it does have some good elements of an unmissable and unique skateboarding game and how the soundtrack to this game is incredibly fitting with a lot of music including being some of the noughties’ most legendary indie rock acts. The replay editor implemented within the game also gives the player a lot of input for their best potential to do cool tricks. Graphic wise the game is fitting and modern with gameplay being buttery smooth which is good as you need to know what happens at that second. 
 
Negatives include how boring the levels are and lack thereof which make some design issues of this game even more apparent. The design also fails to give exciting spots for known tricks to be flexed. The incredibly dull and uninformative tutorial combined with appalling menu design makes the game feel lazy and uncompleted. 
 
This is not the best game to play if you are a skater at this moment in time with recommendations like the Tony Hawk Series being much better for gameplay and a full-on experience. I would avoid buying or playing this game because of how severely undercooked and thought of it feels. 


Review - Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash  
 
3 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sports 
Age Rating: 3 
Year of release: 2015 
 
This latest sports game in the iconic Mario game franchise has a lot to live up to especially when you look at a previous successful sports game in the franchise. Despite the colourful and iconic characters and backgrounds of this game, this game has certainly failed compared to efforts that came before it due to design issues throughout and how limited it feels to previous games with not a lot to do. 
 
This game is set around a huge tennis competition around Mario, his friends and his foes where you got to beat the competition to become the winner of the tournament and become the biggest alpha of them all. Although, it manages to do it quite poorly with not enough features implemented and bizarre, unneeded and annoying features included which do not improve gameplay in any shape or form.  
 
This game is so bare that it even lacks a tutorial mood which means new players have to go in right to it and hope to master their art quickly without any decent guidance, especially at the navigation on the game with controllers is pathetic with accidentally hitting random buttons becoming a regular occurrence and needing to figure working it out on the job which is not helpful as the CPU player of the game is strong which leaves you defeated and humiliated as they are aware of much more techniques than the player and how to implement them.  
 
There are a few things to like about this game such as how quickly-paced the game is and that gives a nice nostalgic arcade vibe. The multiplayer action is also flawless for fun competitive gameplay against other local players such as a loved one. How shots of the ball are carefully planned with the mechanics of the game is another strong point to the game.  The game is beautiful and vibrant to look at with zero lag nor bugs making it the perfect experience to look at without any issues. 
 
The lack of different game modes and ways to play are things that definitely could be improved upon with this game with it feeling bare and jaded after a while and losing any competitiveness energy that was felt. There is not a lot to strive for with this game neither as only simple unlockables that are accomplished quickly are available here. There is also major gameplay infuriating aspects to gameplay here at times as well, especially without a proper and decent way of learning how to play the game and controls that choose to do whatever it wants to do which ruins any chances of winning with the game going rogue.  
 
This game is just enough to satisfy someone for a few hours despite its annoyances but is only actually worth it if you are planning to play in multiplayer mode otherwise I would not recommend this game to buy. In that case, I would recommend an older game in the franchise as this lacks real features or to play something different in that universe such as Mario Kart. 
 

Review - Videoball 
 
4 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Sports 
Age Rating: 3 
Year of release: 2016 
 
This low maintenance yet eccentric game is a big barrel of laughs that will attract any video game fans with the major feeling of childhood and nostalgia occurring  throughout the game that brings a lot of warmth to it in the structure of the game. Everything from the title sequence, to voices to background music to menus, will be pleasing to hear with the whole game from looks, vibe and audio being a massive kick of Deja vu in your head. 
 
The concept is simple with a ball being thrown in the middle of the field and 2 teams battling it out to get the best of out their opponent with the need to shoot the ball into their goals. This game is 2D with the ball being a generic circle and the players' colour coordinated in both blue and red showing which team they are on which adds to the simplistic nature of the game with less is more being effective here. 
 
Actual gameplay here is inspired mainly by football and the US version of soccer but is a brilliant game to control with only a single button to use which is to shoot with by using a quick tap although using the button in different ways such as longer brings different outcomes such as firing the ball at the speed of light. The game carries its humour on aspects bouncing off each other such as when you hit the blue with your arrow, you will be pushed back and leave you surprised. 
 
This game also has an ideal arcade mode if you do not want to play multiplayer with others. It does not become as exciting as playing and hopefully beating your friends while bouncing off their energy but each CPU arrow has its own personalized special tricks up its sleeve with there not being a bore here of playing with a computer for that reason. The CPU can be too stupid at times though with it missing the most simple shots. 
 
The great positives of this game include how it is a brilliant multiplayer game to play with enough options to keep you satisfied for hours and keep yourself challenged against others. Another very strong aspect of the game is how it is an entertaining game even with the slightest bit of design which is still fun and vibrant enough. The game also has a sharp attraction for being different in the sports genre of video games. The game is mostly responsive with game controls working brilliantly and efficiently to become incredibly playable. 
 
The only negatives are how limited the control options are with only a single option which is tank controls and how the CPU of the game can play up at times with there being some clear bugs affecting gameplay at times. 
 
I would recommend this game to absolutely anyone with the fun factor in it being 11 and how it could bring a set of family, friends etc. to play a sports game with ease that could contain a lot of laughter without feeling like any type of chore to do at all.

Review - The Cruel King and the Great Hero 
 
3.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: RPG 
Age Rating: 7 
Year of release: 2022 
 
This 15 hour gameplay story is an RPG game based on a basic fairytale with actual gameplay coming after. This whole game is in the style of a kids’ book and clearly shown well. While, this game can become boring and painfully long moments going through actual gameplay and battle system, the final chapter is great when it reaches its last chapter. 
 
The game is based on a junior woman called Yuu who wants to be a fantastic hero like her father already is, her father is infamous for bringing down the great Demon King and to help her, she has a ruthless Dragon king who she calls as dad which is great assistance in training and support her to achieve this. Each night, he repeats stories about her father that exposes more and more about the Dragon king each time. She tries to help the monsters at Monster Village, helping with issues between the monsters and people while facing her father’s old past. This game’s story is vital to it but gets achieved brilliantly with the story being detailed. 
 
There is a battle mode to this game with the options within combat being standard attack, special attack, item, guard, or escape with each character having a stamina point which duties as health and energy points being used each time she uses special attacks. There are 3 different friends that you see with Yuu in this game where the player has the option which one to use. 
 
There are a lot of good points to this game such as sounds within this game are brilliant such as a satisfying sound to the menu and text boxes that have a delightful page-turning sound, the game visually is also brilliant which rich colours and details areas. The gameplay is also very smooth with zero lag occurring while fighting. 
 
Bad points to this game include how this game can become a bit bland at times and how English users might become annoyed with only a Japanese option being available to play despite English subtitles. Playing in combat isn’t ideal neither with controls at times being unnecessarily awkward. 
 
Overall, this game is a brilliant and kind story to play that is detailed and is delivered great through a strong story, visual and sound design with more positives throughout the game to negatives. 
 
 
Review - RPGolf Legends

Genre: RPG 
Age Rating: 7 
Year of release: 2022 
 
This somewhat great sequel that is clearly based on the initial game works on it in most ways but does not deliver to this reputation with it not being considered iconic nor detailed or at times even as a quality golf game. 
 
The game starts with the main character Aerin just wanting to play golf but is unable to due to each golf hole (54) being sealed with energy shields but a golf club helps her unseal them. For each hole to open, holes that came before need to be done and animals around need to be whacked with her golf club to enable an energy meter and move on into the next hole. 
 
Combat in this game works without any brain power with swinging the golf club hitting enemies, it all contains hitting the animals whilst avoiding their attacks and working on your next move. There is a clear delay between hitting the attack button and swinging occurring so you need to get used to timing to succeed within this game. One can also improve themselves in this game as well by buying better golf clubs although enough credit for that to occur is hard to get. A highlight here is Boss Battles with combat although a player needs to go 1/2 way through the game to be able to do this.  
 
Good points about this game are how there is enough to do here and some options like riding in a golf cart can become such fun, another good point is how smooth this game works with there being 0 lag and no bugs occurring crashing the game affecting performance neither. 
 
Things to improve within’ this game include how it visually looks, whilst it looks good, to compare it to other indie games it does not deliver at all with a similar scenario occurring for the sound effects and music in the background with them being serviceable but not legendary in any shape nor form.  
 
Whilst this is a much better sequel, RPGolf legends does not have anything to makes it an iconic and unique game to play in the market with the game not feeling fulfilling.

After rescuing other members, they only say 1-2 lines of dialogue then fade into the background. High scores here are monitored by how quickly someone can achieve a level but also how many turns, hidden secrets and people rescued come into it. While Dr Science can speak it is bare to non-funny pun-filled ‘comedy’ which cringes a player up and dialogue of guides. 
 
The game’s navigation is split into elements with 3 planets that do change backgrounds and add new features to the game with them all separated again to 6 unique zones that can be used by an overworld map.  
 
This game is a mostly very strong game with the concept and execution being both clever and entertaining. It is also a brilliant game to play on the go because it isn't demanding to play at all. Visual aspects of the game are positive with being there accurate to the mood of the story at the time with each planet looking unique but in an appropriate way, the same with the aliens who look like they are a part of that planet but again slightly different where you actually notice it. 
 
A bad point of this game to some extent is how annoying how short it is as it does ruin the games’ potential with much more that could be explored here. The game can also be quite buggy which is a nuisance, the low framerate also doesn’t not help as it causes a lag which ruins the experience and make completing them feel like a chore.  


Review - Dying Light 2 Stay Human  
 
3.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre:  RPG and Action 
Age Rating: 18 
Year of release: 2022 
 
This game sequel to the original game that came out in early 2015 with a very lukewarm reception is by far a bigger, better and meaner game.  While, it has been a hot second is once this game was announced all the way back at E3 2018. Development issues staggered the game’s release date such as that the then creative director of the game left after accusations of misbehavior caught up with him. But finally in 2022 it is here although very different to the originally promised and shown game which isn't necessarily a bad thing…. 
 
The game is a soft reboot of the series’ story arc with it being set in the exact set as the original although we fast-forward a decade and a half where the world is left in a primitive state. Villedor or more commonly known “The City” is used this time with its being done of the final large settlements in the world with Harran left behind. Players play the character of Aiden Caldwell in this game a “Pilgrim” who travels through the decreasing amount of settlements on a mission to find his long-lost sister. Both siblings were abused and used in experiments into a possible deadly vaccine by a doctor called Waltz and is likely that he is in hiding in Villedor. With the game story getting the player to locate him and maybe the sister which won’t be a walk in the park. 
 
The plot of the story is easy to follow with it leading to a series of complications that expects the mission to becoming harder to follow. With an obstacle followed early on is  discovering that Waltz and character’s sister are more most likely to be in the downtown ‘Central Loop’ of the city. An area that is guarded which means discovering a way of passing them which gets you caught and issued into solving a complicated murder mystery which sets off a massive war between the Peacekeepers and Survivor factions. Getting to the ‘Central Loop’ is a lot more complex that it sounds which it taking longer than 10 hours of playtime. 
 
There is a lot to like about this game. The game is incredibly smooth to play with there being no lag to suffer from and the playing environment being vivid and almost life-like which makes the game really engaging to play because you feel like you are the player and not playing a console. Another big selling point is how this isn't a stereotypical game which the character teaming up with villains etc. 
 
The worst thing about this game is how slow and long the game can feel to play. While, it can seem positive that it lasts longer, the duration of the game can make this game feel very dull at time and you just want something over and done with.  
 
While the story is simple and at times slow to follow through. It has some unforgettable characters and moments in the story and game. Techland do a very good job at making the city feel like a detailed living environment with its own politics and concern and the choices in the storyline are delivered well with the stereotype of a good and bad choice not existing here with sacrifices made such as cooperating with bad people to get the best for the city with the adventure and outcome not being predictable. 


Review - Gamedec 
 
4 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: RPG, Adventure, Action and Sci-Fi 
Age Rating: 18 
Year of release: 2021 
 
Anshar Studios’ new and exciting cyberpunk inspired game has a lot to life up to compared to previous injustice player-controlled games such as Disco Elysium and Fallout. The year of delay of this game has certainly been worth it as this game is a fascinating Sci-Fi experience and universe where the player unusually has to adopt the role of a cyberspace detective who has to investigate and figure out crimes that have occurred in virtual space. A slight downfall of the game is how the extent of how open and configurable it is allowing for too many choices for players to commit which overshadows and lets down the game’s unity, especially at the start of the game which makes keeping immersion much harder than it actually needs to be. 
 
This game is set in Warsaw City which is a megalopolis that is extending to the airspace and created in the wreck there is in Old Warsaw. The lead character and who the player controls have a job role as a Gamedec which is a detective that is qualified in figuring out where people is and discovering any wrongdoings in virtual space. This game is set in the later era of the 22nd century where humans spend most of their time in several life-like online VR spaces where resources such as health pills and sofas are all virtual in longer sessions in most houses were only for those in poverty it not occurring. The fact that someone can be discreet online for those avatars using it has bought the worst side of people in an era that is already declining fast.  
 
The runtime of this game is 15 hours and throughout it, codex entries are found to do a lot of construction and improve their land. There is a lot of private information available for players to find and expose it all through older and alien platforms for time - tv and radio. This game shows a bleak, sad yet maybe realistic future although interesting to research and discover. 
 
The game has a lot of great elements to it with it being a captivating game about the future where the world is incredibly engaging and gives the player power with them being responsible for choices that make differences and are vital. Image-wise this game definitely works as well with the art of the creators being stunning to both look at and play. Another brilliant factor to this game is just how well it works if you want to replay the game with it not being a bore or chore. The game also excels at bringing many different game genres with different elements of each Adventure, Action, RPG and Sci-Fi and creating a very solid game with it. 
 
Although, this game has some flaws that ruin its potential of being perfect such as how there are noticeable mistakes in the dialogue throughout the game and how some easter eggs and hints within this game are totally pointless and vague. The audio of this game isn't the best either with music in the background being distracting and having nothing to do with the story. There are definitely bugs within this game as well which can make it very hard to play without issues and time delays. 
 
This game is mostly solid and is totally a game to play even if not as flawless as similar games. It is an exciting game that challenges players and is playable over and over without the way overused need of having sword, knuckles or guns as potential combats and the need in other games to survive. This is a refreshing change where head is used not a weapon as defense. 
 
 
Review - Cris Tales 
 
3 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: RPG and Puzzle 
Age Rating: 12 
Year of release: 2021 
 
This game was developed by both Uncorporated Games and Syck and published at Modus Games Japanese RPG game that fans of it will love. The game’s story lead is a child orphan called Crisbell whose life changes forever once she meets a new cute small frog who has a top hat and steals a rose from her and quickly after, she is a foreseen Time Mage which means she has the ability to see both the past and future at the same time with today. Taking advantage of her new powers, she goes on a mission to protect the world from the evil Time Empress with a team of bizarre companions, the frog and other people who have the same ability. 
 
The plot of this game is not always groundbreaking although the storytelling is another question with it always managing the entertain and engage with the player with a good example being times where Crisbell can tweak the future for good but that doesn’t lead to a positive one for everyone. The game has a big emphasis on the moral dilemma with the player being tested on what’s right and wrong with a perfect example being how there is a possibility being saving storefronts from rot being possible at the start but only one is able to gain this.  
 
The game also has a big puzzle element to it as well with you using time travelling powers to clear paths inside small dungeons once you move through them. The way that the powers get used in the game are expected and a bit boring but there are enough creative obstacles and puzzles in Cris Tales that things do not become a big bore, especially at the running time of the game is 30ish hours. 
 
This game is certainly a solid JRPG game with a lot to love inside such as a game that challenges the player and the way life works for the better, the story of the game itself is quite heartening with the change to make a change and do good is very apparent especially for others. The Puzzle-like combat of the game is also brilliant with it adding another dimension to the game and pushing the player so that the game isn’t dull and simple. This is visually very pleasing as well with a brilliant and vibrant art style of the game making it fun to play. 
 
Although, the game is not all rose coloured with some annoyances coming up within the game. A big once visually is the low refresh rate making combat a lot harder and less enjoyable to play as moves come to a while after. The fact that you do not have enough time to do certain tasks is another very annoying aspect of the game and how weird it is that there are a lot of bizarre unrelated cameos that go face to face with Crisbell occurring in the game. 
 
Overall, this game is a really good RPG and puzzle game that adds in some unexpected but effective gameplay ideas and a good artistic look. This game does just barely enough to be an entertaining game that every RPG player needs. 
 
 
Review - Everhood 
 
4 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: RPG 
Age Rating: 7 
Year of release: 2021 
 
The game Everhood has a lot of aspects within that brill back heavy nostalgia for any gamer with it also seeming like the perfect candidate to be a critically acclaimed Indie game with a lot going for it such as unique and cool characters, old-school visuals and graphics, very catchy and amusing music throughout and a non-conventional battle system. This game is clearly kind of inspired by old iconic games but this is a red herring with a gamer not being as familiar as they feel at the start. 
 
In this game, players used a wooden puppet who is called Red who wakes to discover themselves in a random forest with it apparent immediately that their arm has been stolen by a blue gnome. In this game, red follows the thief and start the game and journey which has unexpected twists at every moment ahead. Some games here are better going into with no idea what to expect but after a while, it is obvious that whatever is happening is darker than it seems. In the game, Red encounters a lot of different characters such as dancing mushrooms that adore playing hide and seek, lampposts that love a chin-wag and a vampire with an awful cold who is called Noseferatchu. Some are there to be friendly and chat but others are there to sabotage him. 
 
There is a lot to like about this game such as how creative the game is and how fun but nostalgic the games within it really are. Effects are also a really good factor within this game with effects during the battles adding to the suspense. This is not a hard game to play with effort have been implemented that the player can have a lot of fun with it. Music within the game is also very solid with the best coming last which also elevates the final chapter. 
 
There is a lot you might dislike as well, the game isn’t too visually pleasing to look at as it is dated with 16 bit-style graphics that is purely there to bring back a child in gamers. While it is a nice love letter to the past, the refresh rate nor visuals impress much as it cannot. There is also an unbalanced wait with load times while changing areas as well with it occurring quick at times and being a chore to wait at others. 
 
This nice and quick (6 hours to complete) game is a very entertaining and effective game to play if you prioritize fun and nostalgia. It is able to break free from potential influences and is totally its own game with this adventure being unsimilar to anything that has happened before. 
 
 
Review - Hades 
 
4.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: RPG and Action 
Age Rating: 12 
Year of release: 2018 
 
The lead character of this game, Zagreus finds himself in a similar unfortunate position  to a lot people in the world stuck in the world and by an abusive senior figure and try to figure a way out. Zagreus has an advantage to help himself in such an awful situation as he is an immortal god although sadly his abuser is his dad Hades who is even higher up than him as ‘the lord of the Underworld’. Zagreus’ sad misery makes an adventurous game for players to play that even non-‘pro’ games can also admire. 
 
The plot of the game is how the lead character seeks a way to be free after spending his whole life in the Underworld and is driven by fresh news for him learning about his birth mum Persephone who vanished years before. Zagreus gains the support of his adoptive mum Myx, the gods of Olympus who have only become aware of him and other known names in Greek mythology. He escapes through his bedroom window although each time he fails, he is bought back to the hub and needs to strive again to leave. 
 
Most of the game is spent fighting people within Underworld who are trying to stop him and defeat them to ensure that can move on easily. Anticipation is strong throughout the game with the player never actually being aware what will occur next. Players walk through combat rooms in this game to move on forwards and succeed with there always being 1-3 doorways to walk through with some boot earnt with each door. 
 
The game has much a player could and will love such as how the game contains quick action throughout, responsive controls that make fighting others quick and effective. It is also unexpected which adds to the glory of the game with something new always around the corner that could be effective. This game looks great as well with a high refresh rate and nice atmospheric colour pallet that looks excellent. This is a brilliant and fresh Action and RPG (Which aren't the lightest games to play) game that anyone and their nan can play with pleasure. 
 
The only annoyance with this game is how the script can be apparently awful, poor and cringeworthy but the actual game and it’s clear appeal way overweigh this with it still being a good game. 
 
This is a solid game with almost a perfect score that will attract any kind of player, no one will regret playing it. While their reputation is strong this is by far Supergiant’s best game unarguably which is not easy to accomplish at all. 
 
 
Review - Ganbare! Super Strikers 
 
2 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: RPG, Adventure and Sports 
Age Rating: 3 
Year of release: 2020 
 
To start the review, this game was not a too easy game to implement and play with a lot of technical issues happening straight into Story Mode with a lot of players commonly having to restart the game. While the game does sound interesting being game heavily focused on the genres of RPG, Adventure and Sports and has a nice niche and fresh sound and feel to it. It soon wears thin and the gamer becomes bored quickly. 
 
This game introduces a story mode where the player can customize their own player, team and football team badge. After working through that and choosing whether to follow through with the tutorial or skip ahead, the team can play the 1st of 7 National Cup matches they are going to play and they are followed through with the World Cup matches. If the team wins the game they are able to move on within the tournament with winning allowing one to get up to 3 stars with one always being earnt for winning and the other 2 for going above and beyond in skill and for achievements such as stopping the other teaming from scoring, using special skills in the game etc. These stars are then used to move along to gather better equipment to improve, boost statistics and abilities.  
 
There are 2 fields the player needs to be aware of and monitor- both AP and SP. The SP gauge is drained each time a fellow member of the team moves around or does something with that team member becoming exhausted and losing good statistics once empty while the AP gauge is lowered each time a team member uses special abilities such as tackling a member of the other team making you aware it isn’t a good idea to exhaust these moves. This game works very similarly to how a game of football would actually work. 
 
This game can a fun one to play for a short while with it feeling like a nice quick game to enjoy where you do not have to think too hard. The high refresh rate is another good factor that is implemented within this game which makes the game and ball kicking run smoothly where the player does not have to miss a beat. The coloration of the game is fun and colour as well which keeps the player positive and engaged compared to how they’d be if it was gloomy. 
 
Although, there are enough negatives to this game with a big one being how undercooked it feels despite sounds like a cool and interesting combination, all RPG, Adventure and Sports. This game does not deliver a lot to be improved on to become a solid game. With the standard view of a slanted top-down view not being the best to look at and play in real-time with, members of the team and public blocking the view can make it hard to look at. Stupid stunts within the game ruin its potential as well with unneeded ’features’ such as climate and body height affecting the players’ potential which irks the player and how they feel about the game. 
 
This game clearly does not understand the assignment and is incredibly defective which does not make it a good experience or game to play at all. I would avoid this game at all costs as there is not a USP for anyone and obviously isn’t even that good.

Review - Psychonauts 2 
 
4.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action and Adventure 
Age Rating: 7  
Year of release: 2021 
 
This long-awaited sequel to this cartoon and amusing game filled with laughter, solid story-lining and charming characters introduced in 2005 is back and better than ever with it not being just a sequel but a classic in its own right. 
 
This game is set just mere days after the first game and only moments after the spin-off sequels it gathered. Here you play psychic child genius Razputin Aquato and Razputin just saved Truman Zanotto, the leader of the Psychonauts from rogue dental/brain surgeon Dr. Loboto. Your mission within’ this game is to figure out who exactly hired Loboto to kidnap the Psychonaut agents in the first film by going inside his head to discover there is a bigger evil here called Maligula who is a known nemesis of the Psychonauts. Maligula was presumed dead after a war that left one of the best Psychonauts mentally scarred and damaged which leads them to believe there is someone working for the other side within the team and to investigate. You have to go inside the heads of the creators of the Psychonauts dubbed Psychic 6. 
 
This is a superb game that clearly has been well thought out and is incredibly detailed, down to small elements such as the past to the characters and their nemesis and everything in-between is brilliant. This is a really expressive and creative game which handles some real life issues incredibly well with grace and care such as PTSD, worry and addiction while showing they are human traits and at times touching it in a very light way that doesn’t mock these traits. 
 
The game is phenomenal with many good targets being hit here. The characters and backgrounds are nice, colourful and vibrant which makes it a pleasure to play and brilliant to look at. Writing and direction of this game is also amazingly good with it cooperating as a game in a very good and non-jarring manor. The main character Raz is also a fierce and accomplished protagonist to play as and most importantly it covers real life issues such as mental health in a humble and kind way without any stigma being thrown. Combat on this game is also 100% top tier with fighting as Raz being energetic and fun with platforming being another excellent area of gameplay. 
 
The only issue there is with this game is how some fights within the game feel like it occurs to gain experience and power not to finish something on a rewarding note. 
 
Overall this game is absolutely brilliant and I would recommend for absolutely anyone to play it as it can be a lot of fun for all the family. You shall regret not playing it sooner and I’d argue this is even better than the original which was really hard to achieve! 


Review - It Takes Two 
 
5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Adventure and Action 
Age Rating: 12 
Year of release: 2021 
 
This game has had been dubbed one of the best both action and adventure genre game adventures of all time and boy they weren’t wrong. This artistic game takes ideas and takes them to a different proportion with a player of this game needing to be expected to run from moles, spiders in the gardens, battling microphones that are similar to snakes, ice skating within a snow globe and to fly but it is so much fun and a lot more than expected which left us surprised. 
 
The creators of this game Hazelight’s prior game A way out wasn’t too bad at all but this turns it up to 11 with everything about the game being almost flawless which drags you into loving the game. Whatever your mission to move forward to the next level or communicating with giant devices around this game will never be a bore and you will 100% always be entertained here. Racing slugs in multiplayer, playing the game Bop-It or climbing up is only just some of the fun potentials you have within the game wherever you are the bathroom, closet, garage etc. 
 
The gameplay of the actual game is instantly reactive and strong with no slacking occurring here with any element being fun to control such as flying, climbing or running with the game only being multiplayer makes it even a lot more fun and no idea or scenario will be repeated twice leading to hours of fresh fun. The broadness of possibilities is insane! 
 
This game also pays homage to other iconic games throughout such as Mario Karts or GoW. There are also 25 different minigames playable here which are all barrel laughs with a good example being good old fashioned. 
 
Although there is also depth to this game with it being based around a messy relationship between 2 parents who are extremely close to ending it and how this impacts their little girl Rose who sees all and uses the 2 toys which the player is for a shoulder to cry for with your mission is getting everything on track, therefore, it also is an emotional game. Not all entertainment and games. 
 
This is one of the best games we have reviewed with so much being done absolutely right here such as the writing where you are left in stitches with laughter at times then insane pain feeling over the family which each line from them feeling realistic and passionate. The more the player does, the more the parents remember why they wanted each other and belong together. The gameplay again is immersive and the design and colour scheme of this game is insane. The gameplay feels brilliant and the story is masterful pulling every heartstring thanks to the writer Dr. Hakim is an absolute legend and genius for coming up with it.  
 
Although, if I had to criticize 1 element - it would be how it isn’t as consistently fun as each other at different aspects and levels but always enjoyable. 
 
This game is 100% G.O.A.T. and it is needed to be played by absolutely everyone and their dog as it is so good and charming. This appeals to absolutely everyone and games barely getting better than it! 


Review - Human: Fall Flat 
 
4 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Adventure, Action and Puzzle 
Age Rating: 3  
Year of release: 2016 
 
This game combines the best aspects of all action, adventure and puzzle games and create a solid game that gives a different vibe of fun. This game created by the developer No Brakes Game is a calm paced game that makes the player manage and control the character who is a canvas white being with zero detail through different obstacles to succeed and move forward. While the game is not the edge of seat fun throughout, it is fun enough to play with ease and controlling him will not be a burden but end up pleasant and adoring. 
 
In the game, you control the white being and his limbs are so movable that the slightest pressure can make them wobble and you need those moved well enough to pass numerous puzzles to move on and it seems simpler than it actually is with different objects and buttons being difficult to control with how week his limbs are and you need to be an expert at the character to move forwards and go ahead knowing him and he is controlled. Feels a bit like controlling a drunk being which can be fun but also insanely annoying.  
 
The game has been considered easier than it actually s with handling and maintaining onto objects feeling impossible at times. Puzzles within this game become harder and harder which surprises a user that thought it was  gonna be like stealing candy from a baby and it does take around 5 hours to finish this game with each puzzle requiring you to look around before making the wrong one the spur decision although a benefit is how there are different solutions to an issue with innovation being encouraged here. and the fun does not stop there as a player can play with another member in multiplayer which is double the fun and levitates the game, especially humour which is already here. 
 
There is much to like here such as how it is bundles of fun both as a multiplayer or as a single person, how the puzzles are creative, challenge and broad is another brilliant point within this game but despite the player thinking and being challenged. It never becomes unbearable nor frustrating and the physics of the character is a lot of entertainment to play around with. There is also a high refresh rate here which will show your actions immediately which is superb. 
 
Although, it isn't the perfect game with some teething issues throughout. An issue faced is how it can become jading after a while of playing alone as it is the same old and how grabbing onto something for a period of time is a bit corrupt. Visually there is not a lot to look at nor impressive graphics either as it is just 1 player and a plain white background through the game therefore does not look satisfying and feels a bit bleak to look at. 
 
Human: Fall Flat is a really nice game to play for a while being it contain elements of some simplicity which one needs at times but also challenges you for the better and allows you to use your brain in a fun way which is why I feel it appeals and would entertain to all ages as the simplistic factor with solid gameplay is a good combo. 


Review - Nova-111 
 
3 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Adventure, RPG and Sci-Fi 
Age Rating: 3+ 
Year of release: 2015 
 
In this game created by developer Funktronic Labs is both a dungeon crawler combined with a puzzle game which is a combination of live moments and decision-based gameplay. This game does not outstay its welcome either with the fact that it does not take long to finish although might take a bit longer to discover every secret. The short running time that flies by can also affect the game as it cannot show  its full potential. 
 
The player here operates an orange vessel called Dr Science that is abandoned and stuck after a botched scientific experiment. Other people in the team have been scattered at all of time and space where the player needs to discover what caused this to occur and get back to the scientists. After rescuing other members, they only say 1-2 lines of dialogue then fade into the background. High scores here are monitored by how quickly someone can achieve a level but also how many turns, hidden secrets and people rescued come into it. While Dr Science can speak it is bare to non-funny pun-filled ‘comedy’ which cringes a player up and dialogue of guides. 
 
The game’s navigation is split into elements with 3 planets that do change backgrounds and add new features to the game with them all separated again to 6 unique zones that can be used by an overworld map.  
 
This game is a mostly very strong game with the concept and execution being both clever and entertaining. It is also a brilliant game to play on the go because it isn't demanding to play at all. Visual aspects of the game are positive with being there accurate to the mood of the story at the time with each planet looking unique but in an appropriate way, the same with the aliens who look like they are a part of that planet but again slightly different where you actually notice it. 
 
A bad point of this game to some extent is how annoying how short it is as it does ruin the games’ potential with much more that could be explored here. The game can also be quite buggy which is a nuisance, the low framerate also doesn’t not help as it causes a lag which ruins the experience and make completing them feel like a chore.  


Review - Journey To The Savage Planet 
 
3.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Adventure and Sci-Fi 
Age Rating: 13+ 
Year of release: 2020 
 
The story behind Journey To The Savage Planet is a "savage planet" that brings up thoughts of hostility and survival, exploring the possible death through the dangers of life on the frontiers of space. While there are murderous objects out to get you in Journey to the Savage Planet, it isn't the point of the game and only a minor gimmick rather than the main meaning. Developer of the game, Typhoon Studios centers the game on the importance of exploration while tying it with real humour and an amusing tone to give us a light and singularly focused chunk of sci-fi adventuring. 
 
The setting of the whole game is on a single planet located deep in unmonitored space. You're pushed into the space boots of an employee of Kindred Aerospace--a rinky-dink outfit that's proud and humble of its status of being rated the fourth-best interstellar exploration company, which makes you think how bad competition could actually be. Once your feet encounter the planet itself, you'll begin to see the flora, fauna, and beings across the various biomes of planet AR-Y 26 to see whether it's fit for human habitation or not with the whole climate change thing ruining Earth. 
 
This game is also playable as multiplayer with a friend which enhances the game and makes combat much more fun but playing it multiplayer doesn’t affect the game itself nor storyline at all. The option of exploring together or going and exploring different places are both options. Humour is key in this game, while playing with a friend can have its moments. The game itself is without issue funny with the high amount of full-motion videos on the player’s ship. These clips show humour and parody a lot of different topics such as the video game industry and corrupt policies at big companies.  

There is a lot to like in this light and fun game. The stupid but fun humour is actually laughable and engages the player. Exploring the planet isn't a chore neither while being full of fun and valuable things to discover. The colour scheme of this game and how neon it is appeals to the gamer while playing as well especially with an automatic response on screen with a high fresh rate. 
 
A downside to the game can be how satire it is for some hardcore gamers as well with it being off-putting for some. Some apparent bugs also disappoint players as well because it ruins the experience at times and makes it hard to play it with different elements going wrong agitating people. 
 
This game is clearly a very fun and light game that is needed at times when life is heavy as it is a brilliant escape and isn't a chore to play. Playing Journey To The Savage Planet can be a very relaxing experience thanks to its humour, lightness and engaging gameplay. 


Review - Nuts 
 
2 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Adventure and Puzzle 
Age Rating: 12 
Year of release: 2021 
 
This game is based mostly upon squirrels with the player’s character being a rookie field investigator where different resources such as GPS, a map, caravan and a camera will be used to research into the mysterious fields of Malmoth Forest. However, as a player investigates the local squirrel community a very bizarre riddle is solved. 
 
Throughout the game, you will be completing different kinds of puzzles all around such as logic, timing and surveillance). The squirrels will be monitored through implementing CCTV and watching the clips afterwards at night which allows you to monitor the motion of a squirrel and where exactly they are keeping their food. This game becomes more bizarre every day in the game and there is a chance you’ll worry as their behaviour becomes worse as the player. The theory will pop into your head of is the squirrels working against us at all and why is this case important and a thing? 
 
You will think a lot and use a lot of brainpower in this game with it taking between roughly 3 and 4 hours for you to complete and will be thinking by the end, are squirrels allies or a foe? After investigating day and night it takes time to monitor the footage and see traces but then to also link them together. 
 
Good aspects of this game include the logistics of this game feeling quite fresh at the start as it is quite a quirky and different game to play especially what you are compared to playing. The distinct and stunning art direction of this game is brilliant and different as well with washed-out looks and mood board of colour. The fact that most of this game is based upon squirrels will appeal to animal lovers as well with a lot finding the creatures adorable which will send them to overdrive with so much involvement here. Squirrels move fast within the game as well in real-time without missing a single beat due to a high refresh rate and powerful graphics on this game 
 
There are a few ways in how Nuts does not deliver as a game. After a while, the niche factor fades and the freshness of it does not feel as good. This can become a very boring game as well with the concept and what is needed to be done being too boring for gamers with not a lot to do and how it is so weak as a game without much thought being implemented. And despite not being the longest game, it somehow still feels too long and creates much unconcern for the game with how diluted the game is already being an issue. 
 
For animal lovers especially squirrels or people who just loved any puzzles to commit to. I would recommend this game but minus those niches, I would not suggest it as it can be incredibly repetitive and being to play with not a lot on. 


PUZZLE

Review - Cris Tales 
 
3 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Puzzle and RPG   
Age Rating: 12 
Year of release: 2021 
 
This game was developed by both Uncorporated Games and Syck and published at Modus Games Japanese RPG game that fans of it will love. The game’s story lead is a child orphan called Crisbell whose life changes forever once she meets a new cute small frog who has a top hat and steals a rose from her and quickly after, she is a foreseen Time Mage which means she has the ability to see both the past and future at the same time with today. Taking advantage of her new powers, she goes on a mission to protect the world from the evil Time Empress with a team of bizarre companions, the frog and other people who have the same ability. 
 
The plot of this game is not always groundbreaking although the storytelling is another question with it always managing the entertain and engage with the player with a good example being times where Crisbell can tweak the future for good but that doesn’t lead to a positive one for everyone. The game has a big emphasis on the moral dilemma with the player being tested on what’s right and wrong with a perfect example being how there is a possibility being saving storefronts from rot being possible at the start but only one is able to gain this.  
 
The game also has a big puzzle element to it as well with you using time travelling powers to clear paths inside small dungeons once you move through them. The way that the powers get used in the game are expected and a bit boring but there are enough creative obstacles and puzzles in Cris Tales that things do not become a big bore, especially at the running time of the game is 30ish hours. 
 
This game is certainly a solid JRPG game with a lot to love inside such as a game that challenges the player and the way life works for the better, the story of the game itself is quite heartening with the change to make a change and do good is very apparent especially for others. The Puzzle-like combat of the game is also brilliant with it adding another dimension to the game and pushing the player so that the game isn’t dull and simple. This is visually very pleasing as well with a brilliant and vibrant art style of the game making it fun to play. 
 
Although, the game is not all rose coloured with some annoyances coming up within the game. A big once visually is the low refresh rate making combat a lot harder and less enjoyable to play as moves come to a while after. The fact that you do not have enough time to do certain tasks is another very annoying aspect of the game and how weird it is that there are a lot of bizarre unrelated cameos that go face to face with Crisbell occurring in the game. 
 
Overall, this game is a really good RPG and puzzle game that adds in some unexpected but effective gameplay ideas and a good artistic look. This game does just barely enough to be an entertaining game that every RPG player needs. 
 
 
Review - Human: Fall Flat 
 
4 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Puzzle, Action and Adventure  
Age Rating: 3  
Year of release: 2016 
 
This game combines the best aspects of all action, adventure and puzzle games and create a solid game that gives a different vibe of fun. This game created by the developer No Brakes Game is a calm paced game that makes the player manage and control the character who is a canvas white being with zero detail through different obstacles to succeed and move forward. While the game is not the edge of seat fun throughout, it is fun enough to play with ease and controlling him will not be a burden but end up pleasant and adoring. 
 
In the game, you control the white being and his limbs are so movable that the slightest pressure can make them wobble and you need those moved well enough to pass numerous puzzles to move on and it seems simpler than it actually is with different objects and buttons being difficult to control with how week his limbs are and you need to be an expert at the character to move forwards and go ahead knowing him and he is controlled. Feels a bit like controlling a drunk being which can be fun but also insanely annoying.  
 
The game has been considered easier than it actually s with handling and maintaining onto objects feeling impossible at times. Puzzles within this game become harder and harder which surprises a user that thought it was  gonna be like stealing candy from a baby and it does take around 5 hours to finish this game with each puzzle requiring you to look around before making the wrong one the spur decision although a benefit is how there are different solutions to an issue with innovation being encouraged here. and the fun does not stop there as a player can play with another member in multiplayer which is double the fun and levitates the game, especially humour which is already here. 
 
There is much to like here such as how it is bundles of fun both as a multiplayer or as a single person, how the puzzles are creative, challenge and broad is another brilliant point within this game but despite the player thinking and being challenged. It never becomes unbearable nor frustrating and the physics of the character is a lot of entertainment to play around with. There is also a high refresh rate here which will show your actions immediately which is superb. 
 
Although, it isn't the perfect game with some teething issues throughout. An issue faced is how it can become jading after a while of playing alone as it is the same old and how grabbing onto something for a period of time is a bit corrupt. Visually there is not a lot to look at nor impressive graphics either as it is just 1 player and a plain white background through the game therefore does not look satisfying and feels a bit bleak to look at. 
 
Human: Fall Flat is a really nice game to play for a while being it contain elements of some simplicity which one needs at times but also challenges you for the better and allows you to use your brain in a fun way which is why I feel it appeals and would entertain to all ages as the simplistic factor with solid gameplay is a good combo. 
 
 
Review - Breakout: Recharged 
 
3 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Puzzle and Action  
Age Rating: 3+ 
Year of release: 2022 
 
This classic game that has been played for decades since its creation in 1976 on a series of different devices such as iPods and Blackberry mobiles as a simple yet effective game to entertain is back and better than ever. The game which as the player controlling a paddle at the bottom of the screen as it moves side to side thanks to player has been modernized for the 21st century while thankfully keeping the original formula and concept. 
 
In Breakout: Recharged, there are several ways to play the game such as playing the original simple game while trying to improve your skill and improve the last and best high score. While, a challenge mode has been introduced with challenges involving breaking a specific amount of blocks or surviving for a certain n amount of time etc.  
 
This game introduces a wide arrange of power-ups such as having several balls on the go or blocks that explode once contacted. The main survival mode will introduced them at random times unless disabled. Might seem simple but this game isn't as easy as it seems with losing being a regular occurrence at first unless trained on the game.  
 
This game can be attractive to look as with gameplay being buttery smooth and the clear, crisp yet simple neon style of it looking fun and satisfying. With the game being easy to function and play without feeling like a chore. 
 
Despite the backdrop, colour scheme and music being a great selection to appeal to the public, after a while the game and these attributes can become jarring as you are used to seeing and hearing them again and again 
 
If you enjoy playing the original, you will certainly like this as it keeps the exact same formula just modernized and improved. Contains an attractive colour scheme of mostly purple and blue hues with look great on an OLED screen such as the Nintendo Switch OLED model and has a good soundtrack to work with it as well. This is a great love letter to the original while improving the game majorly with the challenge mode implemented.
