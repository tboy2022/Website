Review 1 - Dying Light 2 Stay Human  
 
3.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action 
 
This game sequel to the original game that came out in early 2015 with a very lukewarm reception is by far a bigger, better and meaner game.  While, it has been a hot second is once this game was announced all the way back at E3 2018. Development issues staggered the game’s release date such as that the then creative director of the game left after accusations of misbehaviour caught up with him. But finally in 2022 it is here although very different to the originally promised and shown game which ain’t necessarily a bad thing…. 
 
The game is a soft reboot of the series’ story arc with it being set in the exact set as the original although we fast-forward a decade and a half where the world is left in a primitive state. Villedor or more commonly known “The City” is used this time with its being done of the final large settlements in the world with Harran left behind. Players play the character of Aiden Caldwell in this game a “Pilgrim” who travels through the decreasing amount of settlements on a mission to find his long-lost sister. Both siblings were abused and used in experiements into a possible deadly vaccine by a doctor called Waltz and is likely that he is in hiding in Villedor. With the game story getting the player to locate him and maybe the sister which won’t be a walk in the park. 
 
The plot of the story is easy to follow with it leading to a series of complications that expects the mission to becoming harder to follow. With an obstacle followed early on is  discovering that Waltz and character’s sister are more most likely to be in the downtown ‘Central Loop’ of the city. An area that is guarded which means discovering a way of passing them which gets you caught and issued into solving a complicated murder mystery which sets off a massive war between the Peacekeepers and Survivor factions. Getting to the ‘Central Loop’ is a lot more complex that it sounds which it taking longer than 10 hours of playtime. 
 
While the story is simple and at times slow to follow through. It has some unforgettable characters and moments in the story and game. Techland do a very good job at making the city feel like a detailed living environment with it’s own politics and concern and the choices in the storyline are delivered well with the stereotype of a good and bad choice not existing here with sacrifices made such as cooperating with bad people to get the best for the city with the adventure and outcome not being predictable. 
 

Review 2 - Shadow Warrior 3  
 
3.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action 
 
Shadow Warrior is the latest game released in the Shadow Warrior series which is developed by Flying Wild Hog and released by Devolver Digital. While, the exploration of this game ain’t the best and little rough, this is undoubtablity an incredibly fun game to play at the combat side with the quick nature of this game never achieving mediocrity and always challenging and amusing. 
 
The character of Lo Wang is back in this sequel but previous event not leading to a positive outcome in his life. The arc and villain of this game is an ancient dragon that brings terror to the world and each attempt to kill it has fouled. He is weak against the dragon therefore has to create an alliance with his former nemesis Orochi Zilla in killing and beating the ancient dragon as generic weapons will not slay it. Both of them go on a journey to search magical artifacts that are put around the land in the quest to create a powerful weapon to kill the dragon. The issue they face is hordes of yoke are around the land and it is down to Lo Wang to kill his way through them. 
 
The game has some light RPG elements with the player finding orbs that are spent in improving the character through his abilities and weapons but works as an old-school 1st person shooter as a base in actuality. Most of the combat within this game is set in small combat areas where Lo is trapped until until he has killed his enemies. The game starts with a katana and revolver which is used to destroy weak enemies while as the enemies become badder grenade launchers and twin uzis are used. With badder enemies including huge katana-wielding yokai that can block gunfire or floating helmets whose weak point is on the back of their head.  
 
Shadow Warrior 3 lasts around 8 to 10 hours in duration but there ain’t a boring moment within it with acrobatics being a burden but combat within the game such as slicing through enemies and sudden changes of tactics being flawless. Lo’s sparky comments really add to this story and game with this game being a great love letter to the blood filled shooter games of previous years. 
 
 
Review 3 - The King of Fighters XV 
 
4.5 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action 
 
The 15th! Game within the King of Fighters franchise is finally here after 2 years of Covid delays with it certainly being worth the wait. The story of this game carries on from its predecessor with a mystery being called Verse destroying the previous battle area and being defeating by winning challenges. This time it seems that a new storm is on the way to stop any tournament action from occurring. The plot of this story does not really take the front seat for this game but multiplayer action battling with other gamers and possible moves to use against overshadow that. The game’s picture quality is top notch with the game being stunning to look at with all fighters being cel-shaded 3D models which are impressive to look at and each player has 8 different colour outfits for their costumes which prevent the players looking boring and being versatile. The background of these stages not being too bad at all to look at as well with it being obvious that gaming developers not rushing this aspect of the game. Each game feels personalized.  
 
This new sequel contains 39 different characters you can choose to fight in with familiar faces to fans of the franchise being in the mix. Each character will also be given to a team out of 13 potential ones. Each team contains 3 members each and once playing it is very obvious which game you are playing for. The movement of characters and animation work brilliantly as well with the battles remaining exciting to play and quick. If a computer can beat you in a battle, the option of either weakening them, strengthening yourself or both is available once you lose. This might give the needed push to move forward and 4 different types of attacks are offered here which are Light Punch, Light Kick, Hard Punch, and Hard Kick with an option of ‘Rush Mode-Auto Combo’ being offered once one form of attack is used 3 times in a row.  
 
The game is available to be used either locally or online with single player or multiplayer being available in both with a new type of multiplayer being introduced here called “Draft vs” which does not allow both players to use exact the same character for a battle which makes a game a lot more interesting when both cannot use exactly the same character in battle. 
 
This game is a lot of fun if you enjoy fighting games or the King of Fighters gaming series with it being much fun to use as well if you are inexperienced in fighting games. This is a barrel of fun in both sides of experience with chaotic moves and attacks assuming any player. This is a game that will entertain the fussiest player with ease.


Review 4 - Breakout: Recharged 
 
3 out of 5 Stars 
Genre: Action 
 
This classic game that has been played for decades since its creation in 1976 on a series of different devices such as iPods and Blackberry mobiles as a simple yet effective game to entertain is back and better than ever. The game which as the player controlling a paddle at the bottom of the screen as it moves side to side thanks to player has been modernized for the 21st century while thankfully keeping the original formula and concept. 
 
In Breakout: Recharged, there are several ways to play the game such as playing the original simple game while trying to improve your skill and improve the last and best high score. While, a challenge mode has been introduced with challenges involving breaking a specific amount of blocks or surviving for a certain n amount of time etc.  
 
This game introduces a wide arrange of power-ups such as having several balls on the go or blocks that explode once contacted. The main survival mode will introduced them at random times unless disabled. Might seem simple but this game ain’t as easy as it seems with losing being a regular occurrence at first unless trained on the game.  
 
If you enjoy playing the original, you will certainly like this as it keeps the exact same formula just modernized and improved. Contains an attractive colour scheme of mostly purple and blue hues with look great on an OLED screen such as the Nintendo Switch OLED model and has a good soundtrack to work with it as well. This is a great love letter to the original while improving the game majorly with the challenge mode implemented.
